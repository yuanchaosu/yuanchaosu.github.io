### Short Biography
I received my Ph.D. degree from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2019. 
From 2013 to 2015, I was an Exchange Postgraduate with the Optical Laboratory, Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China. From 2018 to 2019, I served as a Visiting Researcher at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA. Since 2019, I have been serving at Xi'an University of Science and Technology, where I hold the position of Associate Professor. In 2023, I was selected for the Macau Young Scholars Program (MYSP), a China Mainlandâ€“Macau talent cooperation project, and am currently affiliated with the University of Macau. My research interests include deep learning and remote sensing image processing.

I have been a Senior Member of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society since 2022, and I also serve as a reviewer for many international journals, such as IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TCYB, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TIP, IEEE TGRS, IEEE TBD, IEEE TCI, IEEE GRSL, IEEE JSTARRS, Elsevier PR,  and Elsevier Neurocomputing.
